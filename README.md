**Some simple C++ OOP projects for practice. **

## 1. Strange Printer Problem
There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
- The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
- At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.
Given a string s, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

## 2. Create a class "BankAccount" with attributes account number and balance. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw funds, and a display method to show the account details.

## 3. Create a base class "Shape" with methods to calculate the area and perimeter (pure virtual). Implement derived classes "Rectangle" and "Circle" that inherit from "Shape" and provide their own area and perimeter calculations.

## 4. Create a class "Person" with a static member variable "count" that keeps track of the number of instances created.

## 5. Create a class "Employee" with attributes name and salary. Implement overloaded operators + and - to combine and compare employees based on their salaries.

## 6. Create a class "Time" with attributes hours and minutes. Implement the << operator to display time in the format "hh:mm"

## 7. Dungeon Game
The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
